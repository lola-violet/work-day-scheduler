UWBC HW#5: Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
<br>
<br>

# DESCRIPTION
A simple web application to help users schedule work day tasks.
<br>
<br>

# POINTS OF INTEREST
## Current Date
The current date is displayed in the header. 
<br>

## Time Blocks
There are 8 time blocks, each representing one hour in a typical work day from 9 AM to 5 PM. Each block includes a label for the time, a large text area to input tasks, and a button to save content. Once tasks are saved, they will remain in the block until edited or deleted, even if the user refreshes the page. 
<br>

## Color Coding
Each time block is color-coded to inticate whether that hour is in the past, present, or future. The application runs this function once per minute in order to maintain time accuracy.
